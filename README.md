SITU-SOL
========

SITU-SOL is a programming environment for 6502-based computers that was
written by hand during RetroChallenge 07/2015.

For more information, see the [Bootstrap Zero](http://bootstrap-zero.tumblr.com/)
blog (you might want to go to its [archive](http://bootstrap-zero.tumblr.com/archive)
and read the posts in chronological order.)

This repository contains the supporting tools, written in BASIC:

*   `binloader`, the first version of the simulated bit-entering facility,
    used in the warm-up
*   `frontpanel`, the improved version of the front-panel simulator,
    used to enter SITU-MON

BASIC sources for these are in `src`; the tokenized PRG files are in `bin`.

This repository might, at some point, also contain binary memory images, and
text files containing disassembled machine code that was entered.
