SITU-SOL
========

SITU-SOL is a programming environment for 6502-based computers that was
written by hand during RetroChallenge 07/2015.

For more information, see the [Bootstrap Zero](http://bootstrap-zero.tumblr.com/)
blog (you might want to go to its [archive](http://bootstrap-zero.tumblr.com/archive)
and read the posts in chronological order.)

This repository will contain supporting tools (e.g. the front-panel simulator)
and maybe, at some point, binary memory images, and text files containing
disassembled machine code that was entered.
